# README-Generator

Goal: Create a README generator to quickly create a professional README for a new project

Description:

1. When prompted for information about the application, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
2. When the project title is entered, it is displayed as the title of the README
3. When the description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
4. When a license for the application is chosen from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
5. When a GitHub username is entered, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile
6. When an email address is entered, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach the user with additional questions
7. When the links in the Table of Contents are clicked, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README
